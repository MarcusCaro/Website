    <p> My first project was a game called Fruit Catcher.<br>Fruit would fall from the sky and the player would have to catch the fruit with the basket to earn points.<br>We used turtles for the fruits and the basket while using while loops in order to detect collisions and keep the fruit falling from the sky.</p>
