    <h2>Fruit Catcher (1.1.9)</h2>
    <img src="images/GamePicture.jpg" height = "400" alt = "Fruit Catcher" class="aligncenter">
    <p> My first project was a game called Fruit Catcher.<br>Fruit would fall from the sky and the player would have to catch the fruit with the basket to earn points.<br>We used turtles for the fruits and the basket while using while loops in order to detect collisions and keep the fruit falling from the sky.</p>
    <h2>Temple of the Duck (1.2.5)</h2>
    <img src="images/Temple_of_the_Duck.jpg" height = "400" alt = "Fruit Catcher" class="aligncenter">
    <p> My second project is a game called Temple of the Duck.<br>The player controls a duck using the arrow keys to turn and the "a" and "d" keys to change speed.<br>Bread and spikes will randomly generate within the borders. Collision with bread will earn a point and with a spike will end the game.</p>
