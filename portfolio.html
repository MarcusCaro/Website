    <h1>Welcome to my Portfolio!</h1>
    <h2>Fruit Catcher (1.1.9)</h2>
    <img src="images/GamePicture.jpg" height = "400" alt = "Fruit Catcher" class="aligncenter">
    <p>My first project was a game called Fruit Catcher.<br>Fruit would fall from the sky and the player would have to catch the fruit with the basket to earn points.<br>We used turtles for the fruits and the basket while using while loops in order to detect collisions and keep the fruit falling from the sky.</p>
    <h2>Temple of the Duck (1.2.5)</h2>
    <img src="images/Temple_of_the_Duck.jpg" height = "400" alt = "Temple of the Duck" class="aligncenter">
    <p>My second project is a game called Temple of the Duck.<br>The player controls a duck using the arrow keys to turn and the "a" and "d" keys to change speed.<br>Bread and spikes will randomly generate within the borders. Collecting bread will earn a point while collecting a spike will end the game.<br>We used list indexing for a leaderboard as well.</p>
    <h2>Super Mario (Scratch)</h2>
    <img src="images/SuperMario.jpg" height = "400" alt = "Super Mario" class="aligncenter">
    <p>My third project is a knockoff of Super Mario Bros.<br>The player can use the arrow keys to navigate mario across the screen and onto platforms.<br>The player needs to collect coins while avoiding the goombas.<br>The game will end if the timer reaches 0 or if the player touches a goomba.</p>
    <h2>A pHishy Fish Tank (2.1.6)</h2>
    <img src="images/PhishyFishTank.jpg" height = "400" alt = "Phishy Fish Tank" class="aligncenter">
    <p>My fourth project revolved around the security concerns of a company's program and how to fix it.<br>A security breach occurred through a phishing email. The company's program was tampered with.<br>Using debugging techniques, we were able to fix the program and suggest some improvements to be made.</p>
    <h2>Mammoth Simulation (4.1.4)</h2>
    <img src="images/MammothSim.jpg" height = "400" alt = "Mammoth Simulation" class="aligncenter">
    <p>My fifth project simulated how the mammoth population is affected by humans and climate change.<br>Mammoth populations are represented by the brown mammoth icon and the human populations are represented by the yellow person icon.<br>The model shows how humans hunting mammoths and climate change ultimately led to their extinction.</p>
    <h2>Rover Phone Home (3.1.6)</h2>
    <img src="images/RoverConclusion.jpg" height = "400" alt = "Rover Phone Home" class="aligncenter">
    <p>My sixth project was based on a rover lost and damaged on a foreign planet. The rover returns data from its sensors so we can locate it.<br>The rover's four sensors compiled into a single data set and we had to separate it.<br>We were able to separate the data by sensor(light, sound, temperature, gyroscope) and determine what region the rover was lost in.<br>We determined that the rover was lost in the rocky mountains.</p>
    <h2>Making Meaning from Data (3.2.4)</h2>
    <img src="images/Honey.jpg" height = "400" alt = "Honey Production" class="aligncenter">
    <p>My seventh project presents data on how honey production has been affected in the past decade.<br>We used pandas and matploblib to clean the data and plot it. With visual and numerical representation, we were able to make conclusions.<br>We were able to conclude that honey production has increased in the past decade.</p>
