    <img src="images/GamePicture.jpg" height = "400" alt = "Fruit Catcher" class="aligncenter">
    <p> My first project was a game called Fruit Catcher.<br>Fruit would fall from the sky and the player would have to catch the fruit with the basket to earn points.<br>We used turtles for the fruits and the basket while using while loops in order to detect collisions and keep the fruit falling from the sky.</p>
    <h2>Temple of the Duck (1.2.5)</h2>
    <img src="images/Temple_of_the_Duck.jpg" height = "400" alt = "Temple of the Duck" class="aligncenter">
    <p> My second project is a game called Temple of the Duck.<br>The player controls a duck using the arrow keys to turn and the "a" and "d" keys to change speed.<br>Bread and spikes will randomly generate within the borders. Collecting bread will earn a point while collecting a spike will end the game.<br>We used list indexing for a leaderboard as well.</p>
    <h2>Super Mario (Scratch)</h2>

    <p> My third project is a knockoff of Super Mario Bros.<br>The player can use the arrow keys to navigate mario across the screen and onto platforms.<br>The player needs to collect coins while avoiding the goombas.<br>The game will end if the timer reaches 0 or if the player touches a goomba.</p>

    <p> My fourth project revolved around the security concerns of a company's program and how to fix it.<br>A security breach occurred through a phishing email. The company's program was tampered with.<br>Using debugging techniques, we were able to fix the program and suggest some improvements to be made.</p>
